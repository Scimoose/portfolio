# Introduction

The portfolio has been redone lately; old messy projects have been archived or retired, some will be uploaded later or revamped entirely before I add them once again. 

The purpose of those changes was to make room for other projects, which are yet to come, and that will come in next months. By redoing it entirely, I hope that it is now also clearer and more concise to read.

## Portfolio highlights:

If you only had 10 minutes to check my portfolio, which projects would I recommend? 
- **bioinformatics armory** - found in the streamlit folder, it is an interactive tool made using streamlit library which helps the user translate DNA to RNA/protein sequence, locate domains, and much more. All the user has to do is drop .txt file
- **logistic map visualiser** - found again in the streamlit folder, it is an interactive tool that visualises (plots in real time) how the logistic map equation changes given different parameters
- **conference website** I made for a biotech conference held in my university (Wrocław University of Environmental and Life Sciences) named **"Krok w Przyszłość"** ("A step into the future") <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Og%C3%B3lnopolska-Konferencja-Biotechnologiczna-Krok-w-przysz%C5%82o%C5%9B%C4%87-2081177618632303/">More here!</a>

## About me

I am a creative soul, with a B.Eng. in Biotechnology, currently doing my masters. I was also part of <a href="https://2019.igem.org/Team:Wroclaw">iGEM Wrocław </a>(International Genetically Engineered Machine competition, originated by MIT, it's finale being in Boston - read more <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Genetically_Engineered_Machine">here</a>). I have always had a heavy interest in G.R.AI.N. (Genetics, Robotics, Artificial Intelligence, Nanotech), which is why I started programming. Not only that was the reason though, as an avid gamer I’ve always wanted to create a game myself - and one day I will.

Apart from python I also know some javascript, web dev, and C#; I might feature some projects with those languages in the future.

My life goal is to somehow mix programming with biotech, either by doing bioinformatics, or by making non-work related projects. As far as I am doing that either privately or in work, I will be content.

# Other works:
- cryptography folder holds famous Caesars cipher encoding, and the NATO alphabet encoding; with more projects coming in the next months
- rpg game is a plain-text-in-the-console game, but with rich library visualisation to spice things up
- scripts folder contains well… scripts I am content or proud of; I plan to either retire some of them in the future, or find a more creative way of displaying them in coming projects

Thanks for making it through the portfolio - if it is interesting enough to contact me, here is my contact e-mail - <i>patryksurmacz@gmail.com</i>

I'm open for:
- job offers :heavy_check_mark:
- python data science projects :heavy_check_mark:
- constructing ML models together! :heavy_check_mark: :fire:

Some projects, which functionality was lost to time:

<a href="https://github.com/Scimoose/cerebro-ncbi-plugin">NCBI plugin</a>, which searches the NCBI database, with help of <a href="https://github.com/KELiON/cerebro">Cerebro</a>, a search app which browses through the internet and your computer for anything you might want to search. (sadly, Cerebro is no longer continued)

<a href="https://github.com/Scimoose/sciencefair">ScienceFair</a>, which is an abandoned project of mine due to concerns of legality (scraping google). The front end part is more or less done, back end was supposed to be using BeautifulSoup4 library. 

<a href="https://github.com/Scimoose/friendlySalad">friendlySalad</a>, a discord bot, and a running gag in my group of friends. Was part of my journey of using an old Galaxy S4 as a linux server to host files, with that the bot as well.
