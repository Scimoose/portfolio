# Portfolio
A loose repository of my smaller works. Will update files here shortly!

Right now you can find here:
* word2vec NLP model, based on polish corpus made from movie subtitles, and it's analysis
* the python code from Machine Learning A-Z course by Kirill Eremenko and Hadelin de Ponteves (and Deep Learning A-Z in the future),
* little machine learning self made projects, some of them might be better explained on my <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/scimoose/kernels">kaggle profile</a>,
* some small scripts from my free time on the trip to the iGEM contest in Boston,
* as well as a little script using BeautifulSoup4 which pulls 3 most accurate search results from the NCBI website.

# Other works:

<a href="https://github.com/Scimoose/cerebro-ncbi-plugin">NCBI plugin</a>, which searches the NCBI database, with help of <a href="https://github.com/KELiON/cerebro">Cerebro</a>, a search app which browses through the internet and your computer for anything you might want to search. (sadly, Cerebro is no longer continued)

<a href="https://github.com/Scimoose/sciencefair">ScienceFair</a>, which is an abandoned project of mine due to concerns of legality (scraping google). The front end part is more or less done, back end was supposed to be using BeautifulSoup4 library. 

<a href="https://github.com/Scimoose/friendlySalad">friendlySalad</a>, a discord bot, and a running gag in my group of friends. Was part of my journey of using an old Galaxy S4 as a linux server to host files, with that the bot as well.
